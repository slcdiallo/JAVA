Given an int variable n that has been initialized to a positive value and, in addition, 
int variables k and total that have already been declared, use a for loop to compute the sum of the cubes of the first n whole numbers, 
and store this value in total.

Use no variables other than n, k, and total.



total = 0;
for (k = 1; k <= n; k++)
  total += k * k * k;
