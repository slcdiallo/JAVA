(Geometry: point in a rectangle?)

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a point (x, y) and checks whether the point is within the rectangle centered at (0, 0) with width 10 and height 5.
﻿
For example, (2, 2) is inside the rectangle and (6, 4) is outside the rectangle.

(Hint: A point is in the rectangle if its horizontal distance to (0, 0) is less than or equal to10 / 2 and its vertical distance to (0, 0) is less than or equal to 5.0 / 2. Test your program to cover all cases.)

Sample Run 1

Enter a point with two coordinates: 2 2
Point (2.0, 2.0) is in the rectangle

﻿Sample run 2

Enter a point with two coordinates: 6 4
Point (6.0, 4.0) is not in the rectangle
﻿
﻿Sample Run 3

Enter a point with two coordinates: -5.1 -2.4
Point (-5.1, -2.4) is not in the rectangle
﻿
﻿Sample Run 4

Enter a point with two coordinates: -4.9 2.49
Point (-4.9, 2.49) is in the rectangle
﻿
﻿Sample Run 5
﻿
﻿Enter a point with two coordinates: -4.99 -2.499
Point (-4.99, -2.499) is in the rectangle
