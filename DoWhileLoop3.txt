Given int variables k and total that have already been declared, use a do...while loop to compute the sum of the squares of the first 50 counting numbers, and store this value in total.

Thus your code should put 1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3 +... + 49*49 + 50*50 into total.

Use no variables other than k and total.

total = 0;
k = 50;
do {
  total += k * k;
  k--;
} while (k > 0);
