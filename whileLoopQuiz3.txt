Write a loop that reads positive integers from standard input, printing out those values that are greater than 100, each followed by a space, and that terminates when it reads an integer that is not positive.

Declare any variables that are needed.

Assume the availability of a variable, stdin, that references a Scanner object associated with standard input. That is, stdin = new Scanner(System.in); is given.





int x;
x = stdin.nextInt();
while (x > 0) {
  if (x > 100)
    System.out.print(x + " ");
  x = stdin.nextInt();
}
