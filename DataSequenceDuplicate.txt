Consider this data sequence: "3 11 5 5 5 2 4 6 6 7 3 -8".

Any value that is the same as the immediately preceding value is considered a consecutive duplicate.

In this example, there are three such consecutive duplicates: the 2nd and 3rd 5s and the second 6.

Note that the last 3 is not a consecutive duplicate because it was preceded by a 7.

Write some code that uses a loop to read such a sequence of non-negative integers, terminated by a negative number.

When the code finishes executing, the number of consecutive duplicates encountered is printed. In this case, 3 would be printed.

Assume the availability of a variable, stdin, that references a Scanner object associated with standard input. That is, stdin = new Scanner(System.in); is given.



int n, prev, consecdups = 0;
prev = stdin.nextInt();
n = stdin.nextInt();
while (n >= 0) {
  if (n == prev)
    consecdups++;
  prev = n;
  n = stdin.nextInt();
}
System.out.println(consecdups);
