(Science: day of the week)

Zeller’s congruence is an algorithm developed by Christian Zeller to calculate the day of the week.
The formula is :

h = (q + 26(m+1)/10 + k + k/4 + j/4 + 5j) % 7

where

- h is the day of the week (0: Saturday, 1: Sunday, 2: Monday, 3: Tuesday, 4: Wednesday, 5: Thursday, 6: Friday).

- q is the day of the month.

- m is the month (3: March, 4: April, ..., 12: December). January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year.

- j is the century (i.e., year/100)

- k is the year of the century (i.e., year%100).

Note that the division in the formula performs an integer division.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a year, month, and day of the month, and displays the name of the day of the week.

Sample Run 1

Enter year: (e.g., 2012): 2015
Enter month: 1-12: 1
Enter the day of the month: 1-31: 25
Day of the week is Sunday

﻿Sample Run 2

Enter year: (e.g., 2012): 2012
Enter month: 1-12: 5
Enter the day of the month: 1-31: 12
Day of the week is Saturday

Sample Run 3

Enter year: (e.g., 2012): 2002
Enter month: 1-12: 3
Enter the day of the month: 1-31: 26
Day of the week is Tuesday

Sample Run 4

Enter year: (e.g., 2012): 2008
Enter month: 1-12: 1
Enter the day of the month: 1-31: 1
Day of the week is Tuesday

Sample Run 5

Enter year: (e.g., 2012): 2000
Enter month: 1-12: 2
Enter the day of the month: 1-31: 12
Day of the week is Saturday

(Hint: January and February are counted as 13 and 14 in the formula, so you need to convert the user input 1 to 13 and 2 to 14 for the month and change the year to the previous year.)
