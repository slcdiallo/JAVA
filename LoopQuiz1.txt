Write a loop that reads positive integers from standard input and that terminates when it reads an integer that is not positive.

After the loop terminates, it prints out, on a line by itself and separated by spaces,

the sum of all the even integers read,
the sum of all the odd integers read,
a count of the number of even integers read, and
a count of the number of odd integers read,
all separated by at least one space.

Declare any variables that are needed.

Assume the availability of a variable, stdin, that references a Scanner object associated with standard input. That is, stdin = new Scanner(System.in); is given

int x;
int esum = 0, ecount = 0;
int osum = 0, ocount = 0;
x = stdin.nextInt();
while (x > 0) {
  if (x % 2 == 0) {
    esum += x;
    ecount++;
  }
  else {
    osum += x;
    ocount++;
  }
  x = stdin.nextInt();
}
System.out.println(esum + " " + osum + " " + ecount + " " + ocount);
